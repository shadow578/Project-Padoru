# Contributing
You can contribute either by opening a Issue containing a Image Suggestion, or by creating a pull request.
When creating a pull request, keep in mind that you'll also have to update the padoru.json file.
This can be done either manually or by using my Padoru- Manager (repo on my profile). 
The Preferred method is creating a Image Suggestion.
Please ensure that your Contribution / Suggestions meets the Guidelines below.

* Image Suggestions __MUST__ contain:
    * The Image itself
    * The Name of the Character
	* The Name of the image creator
* Image Suggestions __SHOULD__ contain:
	* The Show the Character is from (So I can find the character in MAL)
    * A Link to the original source (reddit post, pixiv, etc...) (NOT a direct image link)
	* Your Contributor Name, if it is different from you Github username
* Image Suggestions __MAY NOT__:
    * Contain Nudity

# Disclaimer
* I do not own any of these Images, I just bring them together into one collection. Read the entry below if you want a image to be removed.
* It may not be OK to use some, if not all, of these Images in a Commercial context. Use for Private use ONLY.
* Information in this Repository is provided as-is, without any guarantee that they are correct.

# A Image I Created Is Listed In This Collection, But I'm Not Named As Creator
Images in this repository are collected from the internet. Tracking each image back to the original author is (almost) impossible. 
If you want to be mentioned as creator of a image, please contact me (e.g. by opening a Issue) stating 
* The affected Image(s)
* The Name you want to be used as Creator Name
* (If possible) a link to the original post of the image
I'll then change the Creator information as soon as I can.

# A Image I Created Is In This Collection And I Dont Like That
Thats sad to hear. If you want your Image to be remove, please contact me (e.g. by opening a Issue) and I'll remove the Image as soon as I can.
